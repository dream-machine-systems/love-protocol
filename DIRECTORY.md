# Directory Map | Love Protocol Structure

This map defines the logical allocation of system resources within the **Love Protocol** repository. Adherence to this structure ensures system integrity and minimizes search latency.

## 🌳 Root Level (Alphabetical A-Z)
- `.gitignore`: System configuration to prevent tracking of non-essential files.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: High-level logic and layer definitions of the protocol.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Version tracking and chronological refactoring history.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Governance rules for Living Nodes (The No-Guru Standard).
- `DIRECTORY.md`: This file (The Map).
- `LICENSE`: Apache 2.0 legal framework.
- `README.md`: System Entry Point & Manifesto (includes Signal Synchronization).

## 📂 System Directories

### 🧠 `/core`
**Purpose:** The Operating System (OS) logic.
- Contains the fundamental "hard-coded" principles of the protocol.
- *Key File:* `identity-bios.md` (The Radical Responsibility requirement).

### 🛠️ `/patches`
**Purpose:** Modular extensions and external integrations.
- Where we "plug in" external wisdom frameworks after refactoring them into system logic.
- *Examples:* `gottman-patch.md`, `terry-real-patch.md`, `dispenza-patch.md`.

### 📄 `/docs`
**Purpose:** User manuals and technical specifications.
- Deep-dives into specific mechanics like the "50-Bit Bottleneck" or "Permeability Logic."
- Contains `field-reports/` (Case studies from actual protocol deployments).

### 🎨 `/assets`
**Purpose:** Static system resources.
- `icon.txt`: ASCII representation of the Central Processor (The Heart).
- Visual representations of the Unified Field and System Logos.

### ⚖️ `/legal`
**Purpose:** Governance and Compliance.
- Templates for the **Integrity Handshake**, **Vesting-Protokoll**, and Trademark guidelines.
- Essential for the legal hardening of the FlexCo.

### 🧪 `/research`
**Purpose:** The Evidence Layer.
- Scientific papers, data points, and links to studies supporting the protocol's validity.

### 📖 `/book-metadata`
**Purpose:** Commercial Product Interface & Meta-Information.
- This directory does **not** contain the proprietary manuscript prose.
- `SUMMARY.md`: Chapter roadmap and core thesis of the upcoming book.
- `REVENUE_MODEL.md`: Transparency on the Open-Core model and mission funding.
- `SAMPLE_CHAPTER.md`: Public preview and newsletter synchronization hook.
