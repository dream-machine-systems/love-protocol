# Contributing to Love Protocol

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to the optimization of human connection. To maintain the integrity of the **Love Protocol**, all contributors (Nodes) must adhere to these guidelines.

## The No-Guru Standard
We do not accept "Universal Truths" without evidence or practical "Field Reports." All contributions must be:
1. **Refactorable:** Can the logic be improved or simplified?
2. **Stateless:** Does it work in the present moment without requiring historical baggage?
3. **Sovereign:** Does it respect the autonomy of the individual node?

## How to Contribute
1. **Audit the Code:** Identify "Bugs" in current communication metaphors.
2. **Submit a Patch:** Propose a better way to handle the 50-bit bottleneck.
3. **Field Reports:** Share data on how the protocol performs in high-latency social environments.

## Radical Responsibility
By submitting a Pull Request, you acknowledge that you have initialized your **Identity BIOS** and take full responsibility for the signals you radiate into the network.
