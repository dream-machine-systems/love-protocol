# Revenue Model & Sustainable Scaling

The **Dream Machine | Systems** ecosystem follows an **Open Core** philosophy. To maintain the "No-Guru Standard" and stay independent of traditional VC pressure or manipulative marketing, we have established a transparent revenue model.

## 1. The Open Protocol (Free)
The core logic, the directory structure, and the basic "Patches" are open-source. We believe that the tools for human liberation should be a public utility. 

## 2. The Narrative & Guidance (Paid)
The book, deep-dive workshops, and the "Premium Documentation" are paid products. 
- **The Value:** While the protocol is the *Logic*, the book is the *Implementation*. It provides the prose, the stories, and the guided experience that a raw Markdown file cannot deliver.
- **Support:** Every purchase directly funds the development of the **Dream Machine**, the maintenance of the open-source protocol, and the vision of the 2030 **Dream Hub**.

## 3. Curated Hardware (Affiliate)
We recommend high-quality "Hardware" (Supplements, Bio-hacking tools). 
- **Integrity First:** We only partner with providers who meet our "No-Guru Standard" (e.g., Quantum Leap Fitness). 
- **Transparency:** We receive a commission for these recommendations at no extra cost to you. This "Fuel" keeps the Architect-Node operational.

## ⚖️ Incentive Alignment
Our goal is not maximum profit, but **System Stability**. By purchasing the book, you become a stakeholder in a decentralized network of sovereign nodes.
