# System Architecture: Love Protocol

## Layer 0: Identity BIOS
The foundational layer. Requires the activation of the **Radical Responsibility** flag. Without this layer, the upper protocols will experience constant crashes (Blame-Loops).

## Layer 1: The Communication Filter (50-Bit Buffer)
This layer manages the compression of the **11-Million-Bit Signal** into the **50-Bit Conscious Stream**.
- **Goal:** Minimize packet loss during emotional transmission.
- **Mechanism:** Presence-driven handshaking.

## Layer 2: Resonance Layer (The Unified Field)
The interface for deep human connection. This layer is active when both nodes have established a trusted, high-bandwidth link.

## Layer 3: The Patch Management
A modular system for integrating external wisdom (e.g., Gottman-Method, Terry Real, Joe Dispenza) into the core logic of the Dream Machine.
