# Patch: Dispenza Neural Refactoring (v1.0)
**Type:** Hardware Optimization / Subconscious Overwrite
**Target:** Layer 0 (Identity BIOS) - Neural Base Layer

## 1. Abstract
This patch addresses the issue of **Bio-Memory Interference**. In legacy nodes, the body often functions as the primary processor, executing emotional programs from the past ($S_{past}$) regardless of new logical inputs. This creates a **Hardware-Lock**.

## 2. The Habitual Loop (Legacy Algorithm)
When a Node remains in a state of stress or reactivity, the physical hardware (the nervous system) becomes addicted to the chemical output of the "Familiar Past."
$$State_{current} = \sum(Memory_{emotional})$$

## 3. Implementation: Neural Refactoring
To overwrite these legacy algorithms, the Node must enter a **Refactoring State** (Alpha/Theta brainwave coherence) to bypass the analytical mind and access the hardware settings directly.

### Protocol Steps:
1. **Signal Isolation:** Minimize external sensory input to reduce environmental interrupts.
2. **Buffer Flush:** Consciously release the emotional charge associated with the "Known Future" and "Familiar Past."
3. **Write-Access Authorization:** Using focused intent, the Node installs new emotional algorithms into the subconscious operating system.
4. **Hardware Verification:** The Node rehearses the new state until the physical hardware (the body) accepts the new data as "Current Reality."

## 4. System Requirements
- **Execution Frequency:** Daily (Standard Maintenance).
- **Failure Mode:** If refactoring is skipped, the system defaults to `AUTOPILOT_EXCEPTION`, where the body's legacy survival circuits take control of the BIOS.
